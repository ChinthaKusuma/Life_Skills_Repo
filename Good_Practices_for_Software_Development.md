# Good Practices for Software Development

### 1 Which point(s) were new to you?

The idea of using tools like Github Gists, Codepen, or Codesandbox to share code snippets and setups was new to me. These tools make it easier to show and explain code issues to others.

### 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I think I need to improve on communicating better when something goes wrong. For example, if I get stuck or if something is taking longer than expected, I should inform my team quickly. To improve, I can make sure I explain the problem clearly, mention what Iâ€™ve already tried, and share updates regularly to keep everyone on the same page.
