## 1. What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a method of learning by explaining a concept in simple terms, as if teaching it to someone else, to identify gaps in understanding.

## 2.In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In Barbara Oakley's TED Talk, an interesting idea is that the brain learns better when you switch between working hard and taking breaks. This balance helps you solve problems and think of new ideas. She explains that taking breaks is just as important as working hard because it gives your brain time to process and understand things.

## 3.What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

* Focused Mode: This is when you concentrate hard on a task or problem, using what you already know to find a solution.
* Diffuse Mode: This is when your mind relaxes and wanders, helping you come up with new ideas and solve problems in creative ways.

## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

* Deconstruct the skill
* Learn enough to self-correct
* Remove practice barriers
* Practice for at least 20 hours

## 5.What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

To improve my learning process, I can:

* Use the Feynman Technique to break down and explain concepts for better understanding.
* Set aside time for practice and avoid distractions with tools like Boosted or Freedom.
* Learn with curiosity and enjoy the process to make it easier and more fun.
* Focus on truly understanding concepts and applying them in practice.
* Speak up about any challenges or difficulties to stay on track.
