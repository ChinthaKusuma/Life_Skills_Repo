## 2. What would you do if you face or see such behavior?

If you experience or witness sexual harassment, here’s what you can do:

#### Write Down What Happened:
 Keep a record of the details, like the date, time, place, what was said or done, and who was involved. This can help you explain the situation clearly later.
#### Speak Up if You Feel Safe: 
If it’s not dangerous, tell the person that their behavior is not okay and ask them to stop. Be firm but polite.
#### Report the Incident: 
Let someone in charge know, like your manager, HR department, or the organization’s complaints committee. They can take action to handle the situation.
#### Support the Person Affected: 
If you see it happening to someone else, check if they’re okay and encourage them to report it. Offer to go with them if they feel nervous.
#### Follow Company Policies: 
Most workplaces have rules and procedures for handling harassment. Make sure to follow those steps and cooperate if an investigation happens.
