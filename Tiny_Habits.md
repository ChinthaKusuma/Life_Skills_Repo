### 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg - In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea was starting with tiny habits. Instead of big changes, do something small, like one push-up. Over time, these small actions grow into bigger habits.

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together:

* M (Motivation): You need enough motivation to do the habit, but it doesn't need to be huge. Small actions require less motivation.
* A (Ability): Make sure the habit is simple and easy to do.
* P (Prompt): You need a reminder or cue that triggers the habit.

For example, if you want to drink more water, a prompt could be leaving a water bottle in a place where you'll see it often.

### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

When you celebrate, your brain associates the habit with positive feelings, making you more likely to do it again. It turns the habit into something enjoyable and rewarding, helping it stick.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book's perspective on identity is that your habits reflect who you are. Instead of just setting goals, focus on the person you want to become. For example, instead of saying "I want to read more," say "I am a reader." This shift in thinking helps you build habits that support your desired identity.

### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

The book’s perspective on making habits easier is by reducing friction. Make the habit simple and easy to start. For example, if you want to read more, place a book next to your bed, so it’s easy to pick up. The more convenient the habit, the easier it is to do.

### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

The book’s perspective on making habits harder is by increasing friction. This could mean removing cues or adding steps that make it harder to do the habit. For example, if you want to stop using your phone so much, you could move it out of reach or turn off notifications.

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

One habit I’d like to do more of is drinking more water. To make it easier, I can:

* Make the cue obvious by keeping a water bottle on my desk or near me.
* Make it attractive by adding a slice of lemon or fruit to my water.
* Make it satisfying by taking a moment to enjoy the refreshing feeling after drinking.

### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

One habit I’d like to do less of is checking social media too often. To make it harder:

* Make the cue invisible by turning off notifications or putting the phone in another room.
* Make it unattractive by reminding myself of the negative effects of scrolling too much.
* Make the response unsatisfying by keeping my phone locked or using apps that limit my screen time. please replace the word cue with another word
